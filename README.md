# Plastic Waste Segmentation App

This repository hosts the **Plastic Waste Segmentation** project, developed under the Jaipur, India Local Chapter of Omdena, a global open-source project platform. Our mission is to leverage AI to protect the Ganges River by intercepting as much plastic waste as possible.

## 🌟 Project Outcomes
1. **Streamlit App**: A user-friendly app for real-time plastic waste segmentation.
2. **AI-Powered Solution**: Leveraging artificial intelligence to identify and mitigate plastic waste pollution effectively.

## 🌊 Why This Project?
The Ganges River, one of the most vital waterways in India, faces significant plastic waste pollution, threatening the environment, aquatic life, and human health. This project uses cutting-edge AI to address this critical issue by identifying and categorizing plastic waste, helping in its interception and removal.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time Plastic Waste Segmentation**: Easily upload or process live data to identify plastic waste.
- **Interactive and Intuitive Interface**: Built using Streamlit for ease of use.
- **AI-Driven Insights**: Advanced machine learning techniques for accurate segmentation.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Streamlit**: For building the web app interface.
- **Deep Learning**: For segmentation and classification of plastic waste.
